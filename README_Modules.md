You have to add modules cause node_modules is very vast in size. So its better you install them using NPM
HERE ARE MY NODE MODULES THAT I HAD USED IN THIS PROJECT =>

@react-navigation/native <br>
@react-navigation/native-stack <br>
@react-navigation/drawer <br>
@react-native-firebase/auth <br>
@react-native-firebase/firestore <br>
@react-native-webview <br>
@react-native-calendars <br>
@react-native-picker/picker <br>

NOTE : INSTALL ALL THE NODE MODULES BEFORE USING THE APP
