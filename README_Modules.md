You have to add modules cause node_modules is very vast in size. So its better you install them using NPM
HERE ARE MY NODE MODULES THAT I HAD USED IN THIS PROJECT =>

@react-navigation/native
@react-navigation/native-stack
@react-navigation/drawer
@react-native-firebase/auth
@react-native-firebase/firestore
@react-native-webview
@react-native-calendars
@react-native-picker/picker

NOTE : INSTALL ALL THE NODE MODULES BEFORE USING THE APP
